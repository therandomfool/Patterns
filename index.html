        <h1 class = 'mt-5'>Why Design Patterns?</h1>
        <p>A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems occurs in software design. The patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well tested, proven development/design paradigm. Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.

            It’s not mandatory to implement design patterns in your project always. Design patterns are not meant for project development. Design patterns are meant for common problem-solving. Whenever there is a need, you have to implement a suitable pattern to avoid such problems in the future. To find out which pattern to use. You just have to try to understand the design patterns and it’s purposes. Only by then you will be able to pick the right one.</p>
        <p>Design Patterns have become an object of some controversy in the programming world in recent times, largely due to their perceived ‘over-use’ leading to code that can be harder to understand and manage.
            It’s important to understand that Design Patterns were never meant to be hacked together shortcuts to be applied in a haphazard, ‘one-size-fits-all’ manner to your code. There is ultimately no substitute for genuine problem solving ability in software engineering.
            The fact remains, however, that Design Patterns can be incredibly useful if used in the right situations and for the right reasons. When used strategically, they can make a programmer significantly more efficient by allowing them to avoid reinventing the proverbial wheel, instead using methods refined by others already. They also provide a useful common language to conceptualize repeated problems and solutions when discussing with others or managing code in larger teams.
            That being said, an important caveat is to ensure that the how and the why behind each pattern is also understood by the developer.</p> 
        <h3>Three Main types of Design Patterns</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class = 'mb-2'>Creational Design Patterns</li>
            Creational patterns emphasize the automatic creation of objects within code, rather than requiring you to instantiate objects directly. In most cases, this means that a function or method can call the code necessary to instantiate new objects on your behalf, so you only need to explicitly modify that object creation when it is necessary, and allow default behaviors to take over otherwise.
