        <h1 class = 'mt-5'>Why Do We Use Design Patterns?</h1>
        <p>A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems occurs in software design. The patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well tested, proven development/design paradigm. Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.

            It’s not mandatory to implement design patterns in your project always. Design patterns are not meant for project development. Design patterns are meant for common problem-solving. Whenever there is a need, you have to implement a suitable pattern to avoid such problems in the future. To find out which pattern to use. You just have to try to understand the design patterns and it’s purposes. Only by then you will be able to pick the right one.</p>
        <p>Design Patterns have become an object of some controversy in the programming world in recent times, largely due to their perceived ‘over-use’ leading to code that can be harder to understand and manage.
            It’s important to understand that Design Patterns were never meant to be hacked together shortcuts to be applied in a haphazard, ‘one-size-fits-all’ manner to your code. There is ultimately no substitute for genuine problem solving ability in software engineering.
            The fact remains, however, that Design Patterns can be incredibly useful if used in the right situations and for the right reasons. When used strategically, they can make a programmer significantly more efficient by allowing them to avoid reinventing the proverbial wheel, instead using methods refined by others already. They also provide a useful common language to conceptualize repeated problems and solutions when discussing with others or managing code in larger teams.
            That being said, an important caveat is to ensure that the how and the why behind each pattern is also understood by the developer.</p> 
        <h3>Three Main types of Design Patterns</h3>
        <ol class = 'ml-5'>
            <li class = 'mb-2'>Creational Design Patterns</li>
            Creational patterns emphasize the automatic creation of objects within code, rather than requiring you to instantiate objects directly. In most cases, this means that a function or method can call the code necessary to instantiate new objects on your behalf, so you only need to explicitly modify that object creation when it is necessary, and allow default behaviors to take over otherwise.
                <ul class = 'mt-1 ml-5 mb-3'>
                    <b>Some possible use-cases of creational design pattern:</b>  
                    <li>Suppose a developer wants to create a simple DBConnection class to connect to a database and wants to access the database at multiple locations from code, generally what developer will do is create an instance of DBConnection class and use it for doing database operations wherever required. Which results in creating multiple connections from the database as each instance of DBConnection class will have a separate connection to the database. In order to deal with it, we create DBConnection class as a singleton class, so that only one instance of DBConnection is created and a single connection is established. Because we can manage DB Connection via one instance so we can control load balance, unnecessary connections, etc.</li>
                    <li>Suppose you want to create multiple instances of similar kind and want to achieve loose coupling then you can go for Factory pattern. A class implementing factory design pattern works as a bridge between multiple classes. Consider an example of using multiple database servers like SQL Server and Oracle. If you are developing an application using SQL Server database as back end, but in future need to change database to oracle, you will need to modify all your code, so as factory design patterns maintain loose coupling and easy implementation we should go for factory for achieving loose coupling and creation of similar kind of object.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class = 'mt-1 ml-5 '>
                    <li><b>Singleton</b></li>
                    <li>Factory</li>
                    <li><b>Factory Method</b></li>
                    <li>Abstract Factory</li>

                    <li>Prototype</li>
                    <li>Object Pool</li>
                </ul>   
            
            <li class='mt-3 mb-2'>Behavioral Design Patterns</li>
            Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication and assignment between objects.
                <ul class = 'mt-1 ml-5  mb-3'>
                    <b>Possible use-cases of behavioral design pattern:</b> 
                    <li>Template pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation deferring some steps to sub-classes, Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure. say for an example in your project you want the behavior of the module can be extended, such that we can make the module behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications. However, No one is allowed to make source code changes to it. it means you can add but can’t modify the structure in those scenarios a developer can approach template design pattern.</li>
